from India, exploiting its resources for the benefit of European industries, lead ing to 
economic underdevelopment and poverty in many parts of India.

liberation from European domination, with leaders like Gandhi emerging as 
prominent figures in the struggle for independence.

Hundred Years War (1337 –1453 AD)  
❖ The Hundred Years' War was a long and decisive conflict in European history, lasting 
approximately 116 years between England and France. Its primary cause was the 
dispute over the succession to the French throne. After the death of King Charles IV 
of Franc e in 1328, Edward III of England claimed the throne through his mother's 
inheritance, but according to Salic law, women or their children were not allowed to 
inherit. Therefore, the French nobility installed Philip VI as king. Furthermore, 
England's wool t rade depended on the French region of Flanders, further deepening 
the economic competition between the two kingdoms.  
❖ As a result of this war, France emerged as a strong nation -state, while England 
became embroiled in internal conflict (the Wars of the Rose s). Feudalism weakened, 
standing armies and artillery emerged, and the foundations of the modern era were 
laid in Europe.  
Portuguese  
❖ Vasco da Gama first came to India on 20 May 1498 in his ship Sao Gabriel.  
❖ Vasco da Gama arrived in Calicut (now Kozhiko de), by sea route from Lisbon,

 Ans: - 
Approach: - 
❖ Introduction: - Write briefly about the purpose of the arrival of the Portuguese in India.  
❖ Main Body: - Write about the reason for the arrival of the Portuguese in India.  
❖ Conclusion: - Conclude the answer by writing a concise conclusion.  
The Portuguese arrived in India primarily for commercial purposes. The late 15th century coincided with the 
"Age  of Geographical Discoveries" in Europe. This was due to the high demand for spices, silk, precious 
stones, and other luxury goods from Asia, especially India.  
Reasons for the arrival of the Portuguese:  
❖ Spice Trade :- Spices such as pepper, cloves, cardamom , and cinnamon were in great demand in Europe. 
Previously, this trade was controlled by Arab merchants and the Venetians (Italy). The Portuguese 
sought to break the Arab monopoly by finding a direct sea route.  
❖ Discovery of a Sea Route :- In 1453, the Turks captured Constantinople, closing the land route from 
Europe to Asia. Therefore, Portugal attempted to reach India by sea.  
❖ Religious purposes :- The Portuguese were also inspired by the spirit of the "Crusades." They wanted to 
spread Christianity in India an d Asia.  
❖ Political and Imperial Expansion :- Portugal was becoming a maritime power at that time. They 
wanted to establish their colonial empire by coming to India.  
❖ Rival European powers :- Spain, the Netherlands, France, and England —were also seeking new route s 
and trading opportunities. Portugal wanted to gain an edge by being the first to reach India.  
❖ Economic benefits and trade monopoly – The aim of the Portuguese was to reach India directly, 
eliminate the middleman role of Arabs and Italians and establish m onopoly over the spice trade.  
Arrival  
❖ In 1498, Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route to India and arrived in Calicut (Kerala) on May 20, 
1498.  
❖ This marked the beginning of European colonialism in India, and the Portuguese were the first to 
establish their dominance in India.

Conclusion:  
The Portuguese first arrived in India not by chance but as a result of Europe's commercial appetite, demand 
for spices, search for new sea routes, and ambition to expand its empire. Vasco da Gama's arrival in Calicut 
in 1498 AD not only challenged the monopoly of the Arabs and Italians in the spice trade, but also laid the 
foundation for European colonialism in Ind ia. Thus, the arrival of the Portuguese is considered to mark the 
beginning of a new era in Indian history —the colonial era.
