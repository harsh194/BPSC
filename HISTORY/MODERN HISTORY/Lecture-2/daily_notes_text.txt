Later Mughals and Provincial Kingdom  - 02 
Bahadur Shah I (1707 –1712 CE)  
❖ Real Name:  Prince Muazzam  
❖ Regnal Title:  Shah Alam I  
❖ Popular Nickname:  Shah-e-Bekhabar  (by Khafi Khan, the Mughal historian)  
❖ Accession:  Became emperor in 1707 at the age of 65, after the death of Aurangzeb.  
Policies and Relations  
❖ Adopted a conciliatory (mild) policy  towards the Sikhs and Rajputs . 
❖ Sikhs: 
➢ The 10th Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh , supported Bahadur Shah in the War of 
Succession.  
➢ In return, Bahadur Shah conferred on Guru Gobind Singh a mansab  of 5,000. 
➢ After Guru Gobind Singh’s death in 1708, his disciple Banda Bahadur  took 
leadership of the Sikhs.  
➢ Banda Bahadur launched a major revolt against the Mughals.  
➢ Bahadur Shah personally campaigned against him. In 1711, Banda Bahadur was 
defeated by Mughal f orces at Lohgarh Fort (Haryana) . 
❖ Marathas:  
➢ Released Shahu (son of Sambhaji, grandson of Shivaji)  from Mughal captivity in 
1707.  
➢ This release paved the way for Shahu’s claim to Maratha leadership against 
Tarabai.  
➢ Granted the Marathas the right to collect Sardeshmukhi  (an additional tax, 10% 
of land revenue).  
❖ Rajputs:  Tried to reconcile with Rajput rulers but failed to fully resolve hostilities.  
Mansabdari System under Bahadur Shah  
❖ The Mansabdari system , introduced by Akbar, continued as the main pillar of th e 
Mughal military -administrative setup.  
❖ However, under later Mughals including Bahadur Shah, the system began to weaken:  
➢ Jagirs (revenue assignments)  were insufficient to support the growing number of 
mansabdars.  
➢ Corruption and inefficiency increased.  
➢ The Mughal nobility was divided into factions (Turanis, Iranis, Hindustanis, 
Rajputs, Deccanis), weakening central control.

Significance  
❖ Bahadur Shah I tried to revive Mughal authority after Aurangzeb’s long wars.  
❖ However, his short reign (1707 –1712) showe d the decline of imperial control.  
❖ His conciliatory policies provided temporary peace but failed to contain the rise of 
regional powers.  
Maratha Relations and Taxes  
❖ Chauth:  
➢ A tax collected forcefully by the Marathas, amounting to 25% of the land revenue  
of a region.  
➢ Its collection often caused conflict between the Mughals and the Marathas.  
❖ Sardeshmukhi:  
➢ An additional tax of 10% levied by the Marathas.  
➢ Paid by local chieftains to the Chhatrapati  (Maratha king).  
➢ Considered a voluntary acknowledgment of Mar atha sovereignty.  
Together, Chauth and Sardeshmukhi  became the main reasons for recurring Mughal –
Maratha conflicts  during Bahadur Shah’s reign.  
Foreign Relations  
❖ In 1711, a Dutch delegation  visited Bahadur Shah’s court.  
❖ The mission was led by Joshua Katlay . 
❖ They were welcomed by Juliana (Bibi Juliana, a Portuguese lady at the Mughal court, 
also known as Juliana Firangi) . 
Death and Legacy  
❖ Died in 1712 CE.  
❖ Historian Sir Sydney Owen  remarked on his death: “He was the last Mughal emperor 
about whom some good words can be said.”  
Jahandar Shah (1712 –1713 CE)

BPSC  4 
 
❖ He was excessively influenced by his mistress, the dancing girl Lal Kunwar , who 
exercised significant power over Mughal politics.  
❖ His indulgent lifestyle made him unpopular among nobles and subjects.  
❖ Contemporary people referred to him as a licentious and incapable monarch . 
Administration and Politics  
❖ Wazir (Prime Minister):  Zulfiqar Khan (Irani group).  
❖ During his reign, factionalism  increased in Mughal politics.  
➢ Turani Faction:  Chin Qilich Khan (later Nizam -ul-Mulk), Ghaziuddin (I’timad -ul-
Mulk).  
➢ Irani Faction:  Zulfiqar Khan.  
➢ Hindustani Faction:  Syed Brothers – Abdullah Khan and Hussain Ali Khan.  
Downfall  
❖ In 1713 CE, Farrukhsiyar , with the support of the Syed Brothers , defeated Jahandar 
Shah in the Battle of Agra . 
❖ Jahandar Shah was captured and executed.  
Significance  
❖ Jahandar Shah’s reign marks the beginning of open factional politics  among Mughal 
nobles (Turani, Irani, Hindustani ). 
❖ His rule showed the declining authority of the Mughal emperor and the rising 
dominance of powerful nobles like the Syed Brothers . 
Abolition of Jizya Tax (1713 CE)  
❖ Jahandar Shah abolished the Jizya tax  in 1713.  
❖ Jizya Tax:  A religious tax imposed on non-Muslims  during Mughal rule.  
❖ Its abolition was aimed at gaining the support of non -Muslims and softening Mughal 
religious policy.  
Introduction of the Ijara System in Revenue  
❖ Jahandar Shah promoted the Ijaredari (Ijara) system  in land revenue administration.  
❖ Ijara System:  Land revenue was collected through public auction (bidding)  and 
assigned to the highest bidder (contractor).  
❖ This often led to exploitation of peasants, as revenue farmers sought maximum profit.  
Relations with the Rajputs  
❖ Jahandar Shah mainta ined friendly relations  with Rajput rulers to strengthen his 
political position.

❖ Jai Singh II of Amber (Jaipur):  
➢ Appointed as Subedar of Malwa . 
➢ Honoured with the title Mirza Raja . 
❖ Ajit Singh of Marwar (Jodhpur):  
➢ Appointed as Subedar (Governor) of Gujarat . 
➢ Honoured with the title Maharaja . 
Significance  
❖ His abolition of Jizya  marked a departure from the orthodox policies of Aurangzeb.  
❖ The Ijara system  showed financial weakness and decline in administrative efficiency.  
❖ His conciliatory policy with Rajputs  aimed at restoring old Mughal –Rajput alliances, 
but his short reign limited long -term outcomes.  
Relations with the Marathas  
❖ Jahandar Shah recognized the Maratha claims  over: 
➢ Chauth  (¼ of the land revenue, collected forcefully).  
➢ Sardeshmukhi  (10% of the land revenue, claimed as a hereditary right of the 
Maratha king).  
❖ Condition imposed:  Only Mughal officials  were authorized to collect these taxes in the 
Deccan, not Maratha agents.  
❖ This arrangement reflected the growing power of the Marathas  and the weakening 
Mughal hold in the Deccan.  
Death of Jahandar Shah (1713 CE)  
❖ Jahandar Shah was defeated and killed  in 1713 by the Syed Brothers  (Abdullah 
Khan and Hussain Ali Khan).  
The Syed Brothers played a decisive role in Mughal politics and are rememb ered as “King 
Makers”  for their ability to enthrone and dethrone emperors.

 Ans: - 
Approach: - 
❖ Introduction :- Give a Brief Introduction about Bahadur Shah I and Jahandar Shah.  
❖ Main Body :- Highlight  the policies of Bahad ur Shah I and Jahandar Shah.  
❖ Conclusion :- Conclude by reflecting the decline of the Mughal Empire.  
The death of Aurangzeb in 1707 marked a decisive turning point in Mughal history. The empire, already 
weakened by prolonged wars and strained resources, rapi dly into decline. The reigns of Bahadur Shah I 
(1707 –1712) and Jahandar Shah (1712 –1713) are significant as they illustrate how weak leadership, 
divisive politics, and rising regional powers eroded the authority of the Mughal throne.  
Bahadur Shah I, also k nown as Shah Alam I, adopted a conciliatory approach towards various groups. He 
released Shahu, the grandson of Shivaji, and granted the Marathas the right to collect sardeshmukhi, thereby 
strengthening their influence in the Deccan. He attempted reconcili ation with the Rajputs and recognized 
their positions, while also trying to control the Sikh challenge under Banda Bahadur, though with limited 
success. However, his attempts at balancing diverse interests only highlighted the weakening hold of the 
central  authority, as he could not effectively assert imperial control.  
Jahandar Shah, who ascended the throne after fratricidal conflicts, proved to be a weak and luxurious ruler. 
Under the influence of his mistress Lal Kunwar, the Mughal court lost its dignity.  He abolished the jizya tax  
in 1713, but his revenue reforms such as the introduction of the ijaradari system (auctioning of revenue 
collection) led to exploitation of peasants. His policy towards the Rajputs was conciliatory, granting 
governorships and ti tles to Jai Singh II of Amber and Ajit Singh of Marwar. However, his concession to the 
Marathas, allowing them to collect chauth and sardeshmukhi under Mughal supervision, further eroded 
imperial authority. Eventually, he was defeated and killed by the Sye d Brothers in 1713, marking the rise of 
powerful nobles as “kingmakers.”  
In conclusion, both Bahadur Shah I and Jahandar Shah failed to strengthen the empire. While Bahadur 
Shah’s compromise policies could not check the rise of regional powers, Jahandar Sh ah’s weak character 
and court politics accelerated the decline. Their reigns demonstrated that the Mughal emperor had ceased to 
be the real center of power, paving the way for the fragmentation of the empire.
