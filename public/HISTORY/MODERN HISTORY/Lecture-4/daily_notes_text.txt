European Company  
The Advent of Europeans in India :- 
Introduction :- 
The advent of Europeans in India began with Vasco da Gama's arrival in 1498 , which 
marked the discovery of a new maritime trade route around Africa to India. This event 
significantly transformed global trade dynamics and initiated a period of European 
colonial expansion into the Indian subcontinent.  
The arrival of Europeans in India was primarily driven by economic, political, and 
religious  motivations:  
❖ Economically , they sought lucrative trade routes  and valuable commodities  like spices, 
silk, cotton , and other goods.  
❖ Politically , their aim was to establish dominance  and expand their empires — a 
pursuit of glory. 
❖ Religiously , there was a strong desire to spread Christianity  and counter the influence 
of Islam  — a motive often summed up as God. 
This convergence of "God, Gold, and Glory" laid the foundation for a long period of 
European involvement and eventual colonization in India.  
Condition of Europe in the 15th Century :- 
❖ The 15th century in Europe was a period of transition, marking the end of the 
Middle Ages and the beginning of the Early Modern Era.  
❖ It was a time of both crisis and recovery. The continent was still reeling from the 
effects of the Black Death (plague) —a creeping death that caused widespread 
devastation.  
❖ Despite the suffering, this era also witnessed the rise of the Renaissance  and the early 
stirrings of the Enlightenment , signaling a rebirth in art, science, and human 
thought.  
❖ A significant turning point came with the fall of Constantinople on 29th May 1453 , 
which marked the end of the Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire)  and the 
rise of the Ottoman Turks  as a dominant power in the region.  
Socio-Economic Conditions During The 15th Century :- 
1. Population Recovery  
➢ After the devastation caused by the Black Death  (mid-14th century), Europe’s 
population began to recover gradually.  
➢ Decline in mortality led to the expansion of towns and rural settlements.

2. Economic Growth : Revived agriculture, increased trade, and the rise of craft 
production led to a more vibrant economy.  
3. Rise of the Merchant Class : A powerful bourgeoisie (middle class)  began to emerge, 
especially in urban areas.  
4. Health and Inequality : Although health standards improved compared to the plague 
years, epidemics continued to appear sporadically.  
5. Technological Advancements : Invention and use of navigation tools  like the magnetic 
compass , astrolabe , and improvements in cartography  (map-making) revolutionized 
sea travel.  
European Exploration (15th –17th Century)  
1.  Background:  
➢ Driven by the Renaissance spirit of inquiry , economic motives, and religious zeal.  
➢ Major objectives included finding new trade routes , especially to India and Asia, 
bypassing Ottoman control.  
2.  Maritime Advancements:  
➢ Invention and use of navigation tools  like compass, astrolabe, and improved 
cartography.  
➢ Development of better ships like caravels  and use of gunpowder  for naval 
dominance.  
3.  Key European Powers:  
➢ Portugal:  Led the early phase with explorers like Prince Henry the Navigator , 
Vasco da Gama  (reached India in 1498).  
➢ Spain:  Sponsored Christopher Columbus  (1492), Magellan’s circumnavigation . 
➢ Later followed by Dutch, English, and French  explorers.  
4.  Formation of Maritime Empires:  
➢ European powers established coastal trading posts , colonies , and naval bases . 
➢ They created global maritime empires , connecting Europe with Asia, Africa, and 
the Americas .

❖ It was a period of both crisis and recovery : 
➢ Crisis: The Black Death (Plague)  caused large -scale population loss and economic 
disruption.  
➢ Recovery : The Renaissance  emerged, and new forms of political organization 
developed.  
❖ On 29 May 1453 , the fall of Constantinople  took place after a 55-day siege  by the 
Ottoman Turks  under Sultan Mehmed II.  
➢ This ended the Byzantine Empire (Christian) . 
➢ With the Ottomans controlling Constantinople, traditional trade routes to Asia 
were blocked, compelling Europeans to search for new routes to the East.  
Why India was Important to Europe  
❖ India became a center of attraction for Europeans due to its valuable products:  
➢ Spices : pepper, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves.  
➢ Textiles & Raw Materials : silk, cotton, jute, indigo.  
➢ Other goods : saltpetre, fine fabrics, packaging material.  
❖ India’s tropical climate  was favorable for the production of such goods, which Europe 
could not produce in its temperate climate.  
Why Europeans Needed These Products  
❖ Europe’s cold and temperate climate  made such goods scarce or unavailable.  
❖ Spices  were vital:  
➢ To preserve meat and other foods.  
➢ To enhance flavor in European cuisine.  
❖ Textiles and luxury items  suited the lifestyle, culture, and aristocratic tastes  of 
European societies.  
❖ Thus, India’s products became indispensable for European life and economy.
