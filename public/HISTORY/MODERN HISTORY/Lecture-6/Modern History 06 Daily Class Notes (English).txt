                                  European Company 03

Portuguese:-
❖   Vasco-da-Gama returned with a cargo sold for sixty times the cost of his entire
    expedition. As a result, European traders were attracted towards eastern trade.
❖   The second Portuguese voyage came to India in 1500 under the leadership of Pedro
    Alvares Cabral (Regarded as the European discoverer of Brazil.).
❖   On 30 October 1502, Vasco-da-Gama landed for the second time in Calicut on the
    Malabar coast. This time he had come for war. He had come to take revenge for the
    mistreatment meted out to Pedro Alvarez Cabral, who had come to Calicut earlier.
❖   Albuquerque came to India in 1503 and set up the first Portuguese factory in
    Cochin.

    monopoly over the trade of the eastern world.

    defeated a combined fleet of the Sultan of Gujarat, the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt,
    and the Zamorin of Calicut at the Battle of Diu. This victory was crucial for
    establishing Portuguese dominance in the Indian Ocean trade and safeguarding their
    trade routes.
❖   Control of Ormuz :- While Almeida's victory at Diu secured Portuguese naval power,
    Afonso de Albuquerque, who succeeded Almeida as governor, is credited with the
    capture of Ormuz in 1507. Albuquerque aimed to control key maritime trade routes
    and establish Portuguese presence in the East. He strategically captured Ormuz,
    located at the entrance of the Persian Gulf, to control Persian trade with Europe.

     Approach:-
     ❖   Introduction:- In this, we have to write briefly about the influence of Portuguese in India.
     ❖   Main Body:- In this, we have to write about the contribution of the Portuguese in various fields in

     The contribution of Portuguese to India made a lasting impact on India’s history, not only through their
     dominance in trade but also through their influence on international politics, primarily driven by military
     power. However, this era came to an end in 1961 when Independent India successfully liberated its longest-
     held colony, Goa. Although it is challenging to precisely quantify the Portuguese effect, their presence in
     India marked the onset of a cultural movement that reverberates in contemporary times.

     Portuguese had the following impact on Food and agriculture:
     ❖ New Crops: The Portuguese introduced crops such as potato, tomato, maize, papaya, peanuts, guava,

       snacks, and produce the popular liquor feni. Cashew juice is fermented to create feni, a strong alcoholic

     ❖ Fermentation Techniques: The Portuguese introduced techniques for fermenting yeast, leading to the
       production of leavened bread in India. This technique has become widespread, and leavened bread is a
       common staple in Indian cuisine.

       have become popular across the country.
