    ➢ British historian Orme described this farman as the “Magna Carta of the East
       India Company”, as it laid the foundation for British commercial and later
       political expansion in India.
Dispute with the Syed Brothers
❖   Farrukhsiyar attempted to curb the influence of the Syed Brothers (Abdullah Khan
    and Hussain Ali Khan), who were the real power behind the throne.
❖   A conflict arose, leading Farrukhsiyar to seek independence from their control, but he
    failed.
❖   The Syed Brothers allied with the Marathas, particularly Balaji Vishwanath (Peshwa)
    and Khanderao Dabhade (Maratha commander), who marched to Delhi in their
    support.
❖   With Maratha backing, the Syed Brothers deposed Farrukhsiyar in 1719 CE.
❖   He was executed, and Rafi-ud-Darajat was placed on the Mughal throne as a puppet
    ruler.
Treaty between Syed Brothers and the Marathas (1718–1719)
❖   In 1718 CE, Hussain Ali Khan (one of the Syed Brothers) signed a treaty with the
    Maratha Chhatrapati Shahu to secure support against Emperor Farrukhsiyar.
❖   Under this agreement, the Maratha army entered Delhi for the first time in 1719
    CE, under the leadership of Balaji Vishwanath (Peshwa) and Khanderao Dabhade.
❖   After Farrukhsiyar’s deposition and death in 1719 CE, the Treaty of Delhi (1719)
    was concluded.
❖   Key Provisions of the Treaty:
    ➢ The Marathas were granted the rights of Chauth (one-fourth of revenue) and
       Sardeshmukhi (an additional 10% levy) over the Deccan.
    ➢ This formally recognized Maratha claims, strengthening their financial and
       political position.

1.   Discuss the significance of Muhammad Shah’s reign (1719–1748) in the decline of the Mughal Empire,
     with reference to the rise of regional powers and foreign invasions.                     (8 Marks)
     Ans:-

     Approach:-
     ❖   Introduction:- Give a rief introduction about Muhammad Shah.
     ❖   Main Body:- Discuss the significance of Muhammad Shah’s reign (1719–1748) in the decline of the
         Mughal Empire.
     ❖   Conclusion:- Conclude by writing weakening the Mughal Empire and paving the way for British
         ascendancy.

     Muhammad Shah (1719–1748 CE), also known as Roshan Akhtar and titled “Rangeela,” ascended the
     Mughal throne with the support of the Syed Brothers. His reign is significant in the history of the Mughal
     Empire as it witnessed the gradual decline of central authority and the rise of regional powers, alongside
     repeated foreign invasions.
     Administrative and Courtly Features:
     Muhammad Shah was indulgent in luxury, harem life, and heavily dependent on eunuchs, which weakened
     imperial administration. Though initially supported by the Syed Brothers, he gradually eliminated them with
     the assistance of Nizam-ul-Mulk, reflecting the shifting power dynamics within the court.
     Rise of Regional Powers:
     During his reign, several provincial governors asserted autonomy, highlighting the decentralization of
     Mughal authority:
     ❖ Awadh: Founded by Saadat Khan Burhan-ul-Mulk (1722 CE)
     ❖ Carnatic: Governed by Sadatullah Khan (1722 CE)
     ❖ Hyderabad: Established under Nizam-ul-Mulk (1724 CE)
     These developments marked the fragmentation of the empire and the emergence of strong regional powers.
     Foreign Invasions:
     ❖ Nadir Shah (1739 CE): Defeated the Mughal army at the Battle of Karnal, plundered Delhi, and carried
       away immense wealth including the Peacock Throne and the Koh-i-Noor diamond, severely damaging
       Mughal prestige.
     ❖ Ahmad Shah Abdali (1748 CE onwards): Launched repeated invasions into northern India, further
       destabilizing the empire.

Conclusion:
Muhammad Shah’s reign exemplifies the decline of central authority, the rise of regional powers, and the
vulnerability of the empire to foreign aggression. These developments paved the way for the expansion of
the Marathas and laid the foundation for British ascendancy in India.
